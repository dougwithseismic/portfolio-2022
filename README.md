This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Proof Of Concept - 2022
Here's a test-run for next.js and modern dev tooling. Let's check out a world where we can take advantage of set and forget version control, push-to-deploys, automated testing & performance tools, a beautiful React framework ([Nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org)), ezpz Tailwind functionality and a super fast, ultra performant and highly flexible JavaScript site.

### Coming up

- Version Control & One Push Deploy - [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
- Typescript
- Headless CMS (Byebye Wordpress)
- Dragon Drop Visual Building where needed. https://www.plasmic.app/
- Customer Data Platform Integration [Segment.com]
- A/B Testing at the edge
- Server Rendered Components || Static / Incremental Site Generation
- React
- React
- React
- Less QQ, More Pew Pew.

Let's get some.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
